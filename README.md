# auto_lab_py
automation library based on pyvisa and SCPI commands

It is intended to be used in the TE lab of the UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE.
It is intended as a quickstart for measurements. Mostly based on measurements done by Niek Moonen, during his PhD.
Default settings are therefor usually arbitrary and usefull only for him.

intended future work:
- add import of settings (per device (class)) via additional file. Can be personalized based on parameters known to students/staff.
- add GUI's per device, with save settings. (per device?)
